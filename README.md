Console based application project
This project was developed in the summer break holidays by me and one of my friend during our training in Java at IIT KANPUR.
This is a console based social networking application that is very similar to social networking sites. It includes the explore option to search and find new friends, friend requests can be sent and accepted. Profiles of different people can be seen. Profiles can be made public or private as well. Chat option has also been included. One needs to login to one's account (obviously) to access everything in the account. One can remove friends from the friend list. Can even update or delete one's profile.
This is basically a kind of clone of other social networking sites but it wasn't updated to some website or webapp. It's completely console based.
We used pure Core java with OOPs concepts to develop this project.
MySQL was used to store the data of the users.
